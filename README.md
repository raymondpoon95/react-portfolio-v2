  Raymond Poon react-portfolio-v2
</h1>

You can see it live here:
[raymondpoon.netlify.app/](https://raymondpoon.netlify.app/)

This website was developed from the default boilerplate react-create-app, together with the main React configuration files. It has been built out and developed using [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). It also uses [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as a backend database to pull in the data to populate the website.

I've put in a lot of effort into building and designing [raymondpoon.netlify.app/](https://raymondpoon.netlify.app/)
, and I am very proud of it! I am going to continue to improve on the design and features, if you have any improvements or advice please let me know 🙏

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Install the site locally to make any changes.**

   First you want to download the repo locally, do so by using `git clone` followed by the url to the repository.

   Or just copy and paste this into your terminal `git clone https://github.com/raymondpoon95/react-portfolio-v2.git`

   Now before you try and run the project it is important to use npm install first, as this project uses npm and has peer dependencies.
   `npm install`

2. **Getting it up and running.**

   Make sure that you have `Node` installed on your machine before running the next line of code.

   If you do not understand how to install node here is a [small guide](https://nodejs.dev/download/package-manager/) that you can follow.

   Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Now you should be able to see it running locally at `http://localhost:3000/`

   Now you can start changing the code as much as you want and you will be able to see the changes in real time as well! 😎
